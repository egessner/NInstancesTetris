# NInstancesTetris
Phase 2 of my master Tetris plan - Create multiple instances of Tetris in the same canvas


TODO:
-   Get Tetris working as a class with a runner.js file (Name TBD)
-   Given N, create a squareish matrix of Tetris objects
-   given M (number of Tetris column in matrix), define the offset to equally space out tetris objects 
    -   take previous M and add padd from the left then use current m for size of Tetris object
